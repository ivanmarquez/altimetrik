# Counter Timer Project

This project was created using Vite to showcase a simple component with a counter and timer. The counter increments by one with each button press, but a countdown timer restricts the number of times the button can be used. Once the timer reaches zero, the button is hidden, and the counter can no longer be incremented.

## Project Features
